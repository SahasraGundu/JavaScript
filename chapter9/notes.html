classes and objects:

Prototypes in JS

JS objects have a special property called prototype.
A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).
We can set prototype using _ _ proto _ _

*If object & prototype have same method,
object’s method will be used.



Classes in JS:template or blueprint of object

Those objects will have some state (variables) & some behaviour (functions) inside it.
Class is a program-code template for creating objects.

class MyClass {
constructor( ) { ... }
myMethod( ) { ... }
}

let myObj = new MyClass( ) ;


Classes in Js

Constructor( ) method is :
- automatically invoked by new
- initializes object

class MyClass {
constructor( ) { ... }
myMethod( ) { ... }
}



Inheritance in JS

class1-p1,p2,m1(),m2()  to use this in class2 we use inheritance

inheritance is passing down properties & methods from parent class to child class.

class Parent {
}

class Child extends Parent {
}

*If Child & Parent have same method, child’s
method will be used. [Method Overriding]




super Keyword

The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's
properties and methods.


super( args ) // calls Parent‘s constru
super.parentMethod( args )



Error Handling

try-catch

try {
... normal code
} catch ( err ) { //err is error object
... handling error
}
