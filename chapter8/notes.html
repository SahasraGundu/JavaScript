Events in JS:

Events in JS

Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution.
The change in the state of an object is known as an Event

Mouse events (click, double click etc.)
Keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)
Form events (submit etc.)
Print event & many more

this is all inline events .using these makes html
code very big so we use event handling in js

Event Handling in JS:

node.event = ( ) => {
//handle here
}

inline handling and js handling both are written 
---priority is given to js handling

ex:
btn.onclick = ( ) => {
console.log(“btn was clicked”);
}
//only one times we can do so we use event listenres 



Event Object:

It is a special object that has details 
about the event.
All event handlers have access to the Event Object's 
properties and methods.

node.event = (e) => {
//handle here
}

e.target, e.type, e.clientX, e.clientY



Event Listeners:(it is like a function)

node.addEventListener( event, callback )
node.removeEventListener( event, callback )
*Note : the callback reference should be same to remove
