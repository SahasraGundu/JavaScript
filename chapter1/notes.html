<!--
what is javaScript:
js is the programming languange . we use it to give 
instructions to the computer

input (code) -> computer -> output

input=instructions in the form of code 
output=makes the instructions work

Variables and Data types:

Our 1st JS Code
console.log(“Apna College”);
Console.log is used to log (print) a message to the console

printing anything donr by console.log

we link the js in html file  inside body 
<body>
    <script src="first.js"></script>
</body>

and when we inspect the page we go to console and 
we can see our output 

variable:
containers for data

Variable Rules
Variable names are case sensitive;
“a” & “A” is different.
Only letters, digits, underscore( _ ) and $ is allowed. (not even space)
Only a letter, underscore( _ ) or $ should be 1st character.
Reserved words cannot be variable names.


js is dynamically typed(data type) language .
fullname="sahasra";
fullname=25;
console.log(fullname);
then it prints 25;



fullNmae-camel case only use this


let, const & var:
var : Variable can be re-declared & updated. A global scope variable.
let : Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable.
const : Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scope variable.


Data Types in JS

Primitive Types : Number, String, 
Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol

non primitive-objects(arrays&functions)

declare the variable and go to console and 
next type = type of (variable_name)

let x=BigInt(123);
let y=symbol("Hello!")

object:it is a collection of values.
key:value (pairs)
{
age:24
name:sos
}

1+2=3
"123"+1=1231
 what we add with string it becomes strings and adds 
 with the string
